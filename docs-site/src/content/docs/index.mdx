**Organization as Code -- declarative event routing for autonomous AI organizations.**

🧬 OrgLoop is a declarative runtime for autonomous AI organizations. You define event sources, actors, routes, and standard operating procedures in YAML. When a PR merges, a customer emails, or Claude Code stops working, OrgLoop matches the event to a route and wakes the right actor with a focused prompt for exactly what to do.

When that actor finishes, its completion fires an event back into the system, and the loop continues. Events are generated programmatically and flow through deterministic routing, not chat threads.

> You don't need reliable actors if you have a reliable system around them.

## Try It Now

Set up a webhook source and a console logger, route an event between them.

```bash
npm install -g @orgloop/cli
orgloop init    # select "webhook" when prompted for connectors
cd my-org
npm install
orgloop validate && orgloop start
```

In another terminal:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/webhook \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"type": "test", "message": "hello from orgloop"}'
```

You just routed an event through OrgLoop. The [Getting Started guide](/start/getting-started/) walks you through connecting GitHub, Linear, and a full autonomous engineering org -- one tier at a time.

## Why OrgLoop

You're running AI agents. Each one is genuinely capable. And yet you're still the glue.

You're the one who remembers that Claude Code finished at 3am and nobody picked up the output. The one who notices CI failed three hours ago and no agent caught it. The intelligence exists, but the scaffolding to scale it doesn't.

The attempted fixes -- better prompts, more agents, cron jobs -- don't work because they're solving a systems problem with better actors. That's like making a company work by hiring smarter people without building processes.

**OrgLoop is the process.** A deterministic routing layer that ensures every meaningful state change triggers an appropriate response, regardless of whether any individual actor remembers to check.

```
Source.poll() --> EventBus --> matchRoutes() --> Transforms --> Actor.deliver()
                                                                     |
                                                          actor.stopped --> EventBus
                                                                     (the loop)
```

When an actor finishes work, that completion is itself an event — routed back into the system to trigger the next actor. The organization sustains itself through continuous cycles.

## Core Concepts

<CardGrid>
	<Card title="Five Primitives" icon="setting">
		**Sources** emit events, **Actors** do work, **Routes** wire them together, **Transforms** filter and enrich, **Loggers** observe everything. [Learn more](/concepts/five-primitives/).
	</Card>
	<Card title="Event-Driven Actors" icon="rocket">
		Sources poll or listen; actors never do. Actors wake only when matched events arrive — each with a focused launch prompt for that specific situation.
	</Card>
	<Card title="The Loop" icon="sync">
		Actor completion feeds back as events. A dev agent finishes, the supervisor evaluates, relaunches if needed. The org loops.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Package-Native" icon="puzzle">
		Standard npm projects with `package.json`. Install connectors, transforms, and loggers as npm packages. No custom module system -- just YAML config and `npm install`.
	</Card>
</CardGrid>

## What It Grows Into

Connect real systems and `orgloop status` shows your organization in action:

```
OrgLoop — my-org (running, uptime 3h 22m)

Sources:
  NAME          TYPE     INTERVAL  LAST POLL           EVENTS (24h)
  github        poll     5m        2 min ago           47
  linear        poll     5m        3 min ago           12
  claude-code   hook     —         18 min ago          3

Routes:
  NAME                        MATCHED (24h)  DROPPED  ERRORS
  github-pr-review            35             2        0
  github-ci-failure           10             0        0
  linear-to-engineering       12             0        0
  claude-code-to-supervisor   3              0        0
```

## What Your Org Looks Like in YAML

```yaml
sources:
  - id: github
    connector: "@orgloop/connector-github"
    config:
      repo: "${GITHUB_REPO}"
      token: "${GITHUB_TOKEN}"
    poll:
      interval: 5m

  - id: claude-code
    connector: "@orgloop/connector-claude-code"
    config:
      hook_type: post-exit

actors:
  - id: openclaw-engineering-agent
    connector: "@orgloop/connector-openclaw"
    config:
      auth_token_env: "${OPENCLAW_WEBHOOK_TOKEN}"

routes:
  - name: "PR review received"
    when: { source: github, events: [resource.changed] }
    transforms: [drop-bot-noise]
    then: { actor: openclaw-engineering-agent }
    with: { prompt_file: "./sops/pr-review.md" }

  - name: "Dev session done"
    when: { source: claude-code, events: [actor.stopped] }
    then: { actor: openclaw-engineering-agent }
```

Read that and you see an organization's nervous system. Every event that matters, where it goes, what responds. If there's a gap -- a lifecycle event with no route -- it's visible.

## Examples

Each example is a self-contained project you can copy and run. They're ordered by complexity:

| Example | What you need | What you get |
|---------|--------------|--------------|
| [**Minimal**](/examples/minimal/) | Nothing | Webhook in, console out. Learn the config format. |
| [**GitHub to Slack**](/examples/github-to-slack/) | GitHub token, Slack webhook | Real PR events → Slack notifications |
| [**Engineering Org**](/examples/engineering-org/) | GitHub, Linear, Claude Code, OpenClaw | Full autonomous engineering org with 5 routes |
| [**Multi-Agent Supervisor**](/examples/multi-agent-supervisor/) | GitHub, Claude Code, OpenClaw | The feedback loop: actor completion → supervisor → re-dispatch |

## Get Started

The [Getting Started guide](/start/getting-started/) walks you through three tiers: a local webhook (2 min), connecting GitHub (10 min), and a full autonomous engineering org (30 min). Or read [What is OrgLoop?](/start/what-is-orgloop/) for a deeper introduction to Organization as Code.
